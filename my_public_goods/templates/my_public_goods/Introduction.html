	<h4>Please read the following instructions carefully:</h4>

	<ul>
		<li>
			Today you will be playing a <i>public goods</i> game.
		</li>
		<li>
			There will be <b>two sessions</b> and <b>six rounds per session</b>, so you
			will play a <b>total of 12 rounds</b>.
		</li>
		<li>
			You have been <b>randomly assigned to a group</b>. Each group has <b>{{ Constants.players_per_group }}
			participants</b>. Members of your group are distributed throughout the room and will remain anonymous
			throughout this experiment. You will remain a part of this group for the duration of the experiment.
		</li>
		<li>
			In each round, you will be given an <b>endowment of {{ Constants.endowment }}</b>
			and will have <b>opportunity to contribute from that endowment
			to the group</b>.
		</li>
		<li>
			Once all {{ Constants.players_per_group }} members of your group
			have decided how much to contribute, the <b>sum of contributions to the group
			will be multiplied by {{ Constants.efficiency_factor }} and divided evenly
			among all {{ Constants.players_per_group }} group members</b>.
		</li>
		<li>
			Finally, a ranking of group members by the amount contributed to the group will be displayed
			and <b>each group member will have the chance to sanction other group members for their
			lack of contribution to the group</b>. It <b>costs {{ Constants.sanction_fee }} to
			sanction another group member</b>, and the <b>group member being sanctioned will receive
			a penalty of {{ Constants.sanction_penalty }}</b>.
		</li>
		<li>
			At the end of this experiment, <b>one round will be selected and participants
			will be paid the amount that they ended that round with</b>.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		When you have finished reading the instructions, you may advance to the next page. You will be asked to answer a
		few questions to confirm that you understand the rules of the game.
