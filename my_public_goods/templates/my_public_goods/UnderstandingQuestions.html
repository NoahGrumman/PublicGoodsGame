				Today you will be playing a <i>public goods</i> game.
			</li>
			<li>
				There will be <b>two sessions</b> and <b>six rounds per session</b>, so you
				will play a <b>total of 12 rounds</b>.
			</li>
			<li>
				You have been <b>randomly assigned to a group</b>. Each group has <b>{{ Constants.players_per_group }}
				participants</b>. Members of your group are distributed throughout the room and will remain anonymous
				throughout this experiment. You will remain a part of this group for the duration of the experiment.
			</li>
			<li>
				In each round, you will be given an <b>endowment of {{ Constants.endowment }}</b>
				and will have <b>opportunity to contribute from that endowment
				to the group</b>.
			</li>
			<li>
				Once all {{ Constants.players_per_group }} members of your group
				have decided how much to contribute, the <b>sum of contributions to the group
				will be multiplied by {{ Constants.efficiency_factor }} and divided evenly
				among all {{ Constants.players_per_group }} group members</b>.
			</li>
			<li>
				Finally, a ranking of group members by the amount contributed to the group will be displayed
				and <b>each group member will have the chance to sanction other group members for their
				lack of contribution to the group</b>. It <b>costs {{ Constants.sanction_fee }} to
				sanction another group member</b>, and the <b>group member being sanctioned will receive
				a penalty of {{ Constants.sanction_penalty }}</b>.
			</li>
			<li>
				At the end of this experiment, <b>one round will be randomly selected and participants
				will be paid the amount that they ended that round with</b>.
