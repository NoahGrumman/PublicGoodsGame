# Public Goods Game

## Purpose
A behavioral econommics lab experiment to test the effect of social rewards on norm enforcement. The experiment will be run in Fall 2015. Built using [oTree](https://github.com/oTree-org/oTree), an open-source Python platform for building lab experiments (10x better than [zTree](http://www.ztree.uzh.ch/index.html)).

## Run locally
Make sure that you have Python 2.7 installed, then [install oTree](http://otree.readthedocs.org/en/latest/setup.html).
Then, enter the following:
```
git clone git@github.com:NoahGrumman/PublicGoodsGame.git
cd PublicGoodsGame
otree resetdb
otree runserver
```

## Site
This project may or may not still be live at [https://grumman-publicgoods.herokuapp.com/](https://grumman-publicgoods.herokuapp.com/)

## Todo
- Decide on efficiency factor, endowment size, etc.
- Decide on group sizes. Will this need to be changed once we see how many people actually show up?
